shopcn is an open-source self-hosted marketplace for shadcn components. It can be set up by component creators to monetize their components and templates. Anything which is compatible with shadcn registry can be used to sell on the marketplace.

## Mission

The mission is to make it easier for everyone to monetize their components and templates without needing them to worry about all the technicalities associated with doing something like that.

There are not a lot of people developing in this space and we think that the shadcn registry is very powerful and if used correctly, can be used for really amazing developer experiences.

We want to add an authentication layer to the your shadcn registry, so that only people who purchase your work can be allowed to use it.

## Why shopcn?

We provide authentication for the user out of the box. Users can register, and purchase their components, and the inventory is maintained for them. You can bring your own Stripe key, so that you can maximize your profits and not worry about us taking a cut.

Purchasers can generate temporary API keys which are valid for **five** minutes. Every install automatically invalidates the key and the user must generate a new one to install the same/other components.

## Team

Being a completely open-source project with no funding, currently only one person is working on this project, and that is [@atharvadeosthale](https://github.com/atharvadeosthale). We are looking for more contributors, so feel free to read the contribution guidelines!
